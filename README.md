# Language-Identification

This project focuses on identifying languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada) from audio files by classifying their spectrograms using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Features

    Audio Preprocessing: Converts audio files into spectrograms for feature extraction.
    Deep Learning Model: Uses CNN for image-based classification of spectrograms.
    Language Support: Classifies audio files into four languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada.

Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    TensorFlow/PyTorch
    Flask (for deployment)
    Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
